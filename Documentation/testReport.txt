Dear new student which has been given the honor to continue our project. 
In this file, I will list all the currenctly implemented functions in the model and state their tests result.
Keys : 
     "OK" means that this function has been tested and didn't show any bug
     "In progress" means that the function has not been tested yet and is to use with precautions.
     "TODO" means that this function is not even completed and still need work on it to finish.
